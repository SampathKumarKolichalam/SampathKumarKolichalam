## About Me

👋 Hi, I am Sampath Kumar Kolichalam — a Cloud Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable data platforms and production data pipelines in enterprise environments.

I specialize in designing and operating cloud-native ETL pipelines, distributed data processing, and reliable data infrastructure on AWS. My work focuses on transforming high-volume 
raw data into trusted datasets that support analytics, reporting, and machine learning systems.

**Currently, I work on large-scale financial data workflows where I:**

• Develop batch and streaming data pipelines using PySpark, Apache Airflow, and Kafka.
• Build serverless ingestion and orchestration workflows using AWS Glue, Lambda, and Step Functions.
• Optimize data warehousing solutions in Amazon Redshift.
• Implement data quality validation and monitoring frameworks.
• Enable ML and LLM workflows through feature engineering and production data pipelines.

**Beyond work, I have completed academic and personal projects:**

- Pneumonia Detection with Vision Transformers (ViT + CNN) – achieved >90% accuracy.
- Smart Resume Analyzer (NLP + FastAPI) – automated insights & job match scoring.
- House Price Prediction (ML + Flask) – real-time property price estimation.
- IoT Smart Plant Watering System (Arduino + Sensors) – automated irrigation with data-driven control.
- I enjoy solving engineering problems from Scalable Data Pipelines, Backend APIs, scalable cloud deployments, and real-time ML/AI-driven analytics.

**Core Skills:**
**Programming & Scripting:** Python, SQL, Java, Bash/Shell, Linux.
**Databases & Storage:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Hive, Spark SQL, Delta Lake, Amazon Redshift.
**Big Data Engineering:** PySpark, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, Kafka, Hadoop (HDFS/Hive), Databricks, ETL/ELT Pipelines, Data Modeling.
**Cloud & Data Platforms:** AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Step Functions, Athena), Azure (ADF, Databricks), Data Lake & Lakehouse Architecture, Snowflake.
**DevOps & Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), Infrastructure as Code.
**Applied AI & LLMs:** Feature Engineering, Embeddings, Vector Databases (Qdrant), Semantic Search, RAG Pipelines, LLM Data Preparation.
**Monitoring & Observability:** Pipeline Monitoring, Data Quality Validation, Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Power BI.
**Tools & Practices:** Git, DBT, Pytest, REST APIs, Agile/Scrum, JIRA, SDLC.
