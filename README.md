## About Me

👋 Hi, I am Sampath Kumar Kolichalam, a Cloud Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable data pipelines and cloud-native data platforms. I work with AWS, PySpark, Airflow, Kafka, and distributed processing systems to transform raw, high-volume data into reliable datasets for analytics and machine learning. My focus is on automation, data quality, and production-ready data infrastructure. Alongside my professional work, I build end-to-end AI and data applications — including an NLP-based Smart Resume Analyzer, ML prediction systems, and real-time analytics dashboards, demonstrating practical experience in backend engineering, data engineering, and applied AI/ML.
