## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Sampath Kumar Kolichalam â€” a Data Engineer with 2+ years of experience designing and deploying scalable pipelines. I work at the intersection of big data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and software engineering.

**Currently at JOBSNPROFILES LLC, I contribute to an AI-Powered Recruitment SaaS platform where I:**
- Built a scalable batch resume parsing pipeline using PySpark, Airflow, Hadoop, and Azure Data Factory.
- Developed a resume parsing pipeline with Kafka & Spring Boot Microservices on AKS with REST API's.
- Integrated Ollama & Deepseek LLMs to convert resumes into structured JSON formats.
- Enabled monitoring with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Power BI to track pipeline health & latency.
- Integrate Solr and Vector DBs for intelligent candidate-job matching and semantic search workflows.

**Beyond work, I have completed academic and personal projects:**
- Pneumonia Detection with Vision Transformers (ViT + CNN) â€“ achieved >90% accuracy.
- Smart Resume Analyzer (NLP + FastAPI) â€“ automated insights & job match scoring.
- House Price Prediction (ML + Flask) â€“ real-time property price estimation.
- IoT Smart Plant Watering System (Arduino + Sensors) â€“ automated irrigation with data-driven control.
- I enjoy solving engineering problems from Scalable Data Pipelines, Backend APIs, scalable cloud deployments, and real-time AI-driven analytics.
