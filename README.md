- I also worked on Annabooks, a QuickBooks-like SaaS platform, collaborating with finance teams to build accounting workflows, reporting dashboards, and microservices.

**Beyond work, I have completed academic and personal projects :- **
- Pneumonia Detection with Vision Transformers (ViT + CNN) – achieved >90% accuracy.
- Smart Resume Analyzer (NLP + FastAPI) – automated insights & job match scoring.
- House Price Prediction (ML + Flask) – real-time property price estimation.
- IoT Smart Plant Watering System (Arduino + Sensors) – automated irrigation with data-driven control.
- I enjoy solving engineering problems from UI/UX to backend APIs, scalable cloud deployments, and real-time AI-driven analytics.
